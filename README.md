# learn_routing_nextjs

Welcome to the **learn_routing_nextjs** project! This repository is a demo project where I am diving deep into the routing and page rendering capabilities of Next.js. The goal is to understand and master the various aspects of Next.js routing, including dynamic routes, nested routes, and custom 404 pages.

## Introduction

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and client-side rendering. This project focuses on exploring the routing mechanisms provided by Next.js, including:

- Static routes
- Dynamic routes
- Nested routes
- Custom 404 pages
- API routes

## Features

- **Static Routes**: Simple and straightforward routes for static pages.
- **Dynamic Routes**: Routes that handle dynamic segments using parameters.
- **Nested Routes**: Organizing routes in a nested manner for better structure.
- **Custom 404 Page**: A custom 404 page to handle not-found routes.
- **API Routes**: Creating API endpoints within the Next.js application.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/learn_routing_nextjs.git
2. **Install dependencies:**

   pnpm install
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
4. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the application in action.

## Usage

Explore the different routes and pages to understand how routing works in Next.js. Modify the existing routes or add new ones to experiment with various routing scenarios.
